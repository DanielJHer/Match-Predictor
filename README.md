# Match-Predictor

In the modern world, dating has become significantly virtualized via dating applications. And although online dating is arguably easier to meet new people in some ways, it also presents some challenges as well. There may be a lot of uncertainty for users of dating applications as well as lack of objective understanding of where users fit in the overall dating pool. Users could therefore benefit to understand the likelihood of their success in the dating app world with their own individual information. More awareness of where the user stands in the dating pool could even increase their likelihood of successful dating. 

This proposed solution will use a linear regression model as a non-descriptive technique to learn from the dataset and accurately make predictions to provide feedback for the user based on their own provided information. The variables in the dataset which will be used to train the model includes: gender, whether or not the user purchased the VIP dating application membership, income, children, age, and subjective rating of attractiveness (1-10). The dataset is drawn from a pool of 1000 users. 

The application is developed as a standalon Python executable using various Python libraries and data analytic tools. This application will be presented first as a simple GUI where the user can input their features and information, and the application will then return the number of matches that the user can likely expect to receive given those variables using the trained model.
