ANALYSIS:
1.	Project topic and description:
In the modern world, dating has become significantly virtualized via dating applications. It has become a huge industry and never before has so many people met their significant others online. Consequently, large datasets have also been collected as a result of people using such dating applications. Although dating has now been significantly virtualized and arguably easier to meet new people in some ways, it also presents some challenges as well. There may be a lot of uncertainty for users of dating applications as well as lack of objective understanding of where users fit in the overall dating pool. Users could therefore benefit to understand the likelihood of their success in the dating app world with their own individual information. More awareness of where the user stands in the dating pool could even increase their likelihood of successful dating. 
The project topic is using a linear regression model to predict the number of matches a user is likely to receive given the information that they provide. The variables in the dataset which will be used to train the model includes: gender, whether or not the user purchased the VIP dating application membership, income, children, age, and subjective rating of attractiveness (1-10). The dataset is drawn from a pool of 1000 users. The results from this application can be useful for the user in a variety of ways and can also be another feature to add to this dating application, increasing the dating app companyâ€™s revenue. 

2.	Project purpose and goals:
The proposed project purpose is to demonstrate how a linear regression model trained with the dataset variables can accurately predict the number of matches a user would receive based on their provided information. This solves the problem of ambiguity or uncertainty for the user of a dating application which, when solved, can also empower the user to increase their likelihood for more successful matches. Additionally, this provides another feature that the dating application company can use to generate more revenue. Therefore, the goal is to increase positive user experience for users of the dating application, while also to generate more revenue and stakeholder value for the dating application company. 

3.	Descriptive method:
The proposed project will use three data visualization tools in order to help understand the data from the dataset. The data visualization tools include a histogram of the number of matches, a scatter plot of attractiveness vs. matches, and a box plot of income by age. 

4.	Predictive or prescriptive method:
The proposed project will use a linear regression model as a non-descriptive technique to learn from the dataset and accurately make predictions. The program will use this trained model to provide feedback for the user based on their own provided information.
